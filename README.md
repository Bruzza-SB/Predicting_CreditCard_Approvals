# Predicting Credit Card Approvals

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a credit card application will be approved or rejected. The project utilizes a dataset containing a mixture of numerical and categorical features, which are preprocessed and analyzed to create an accurate classifier. The goal is to provide a tool that automates the credit card approval process, similar to how real banks operate.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of anonymized features related to credit card applicants, including both numerical and categorical attributes. The dataset may contain missing values, varying value ranges, and requires preprocessing before model training.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository

2. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to set up a virtual environment for this project

3. Explore the `notebook` to understand the data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation process.

4. Run the notebook to replicate the project pipeline. Adjust parameters and experiment as needed.
